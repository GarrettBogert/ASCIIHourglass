This is an ascii hourglass animation simulation. I saw on the internet that someone had made one of these and it was interesting asthetically as well as from a problem solving perspective. I made it a challenge to myself to make my own without referencing other peoples existing code. It turns out in a 2 dimensional grid, the sand can only behave in 4 ways from frame to frame:

-Fall down
-Fall down/right
-Fall down/left
-Rest
